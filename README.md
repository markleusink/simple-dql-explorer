# simple-dql-explorer

Simple DQL Explorer application.

Demo application to show how you can start using DQL in HCL Domino v10+. This demo is meant as a much more simple alternative to the DQL Explorer application that IBM provided (https://github.com/icstechsales/dql-explorer). You won't find any LotusScript or React in this one ;-). This version was built using a simple XPage and a Java backend.

See my blog at https://linqed.eu for more information.

The data used in this application was generated using https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/

## Quickstart

To use this demo application you'll need a HCL Domino v10 server (or higher). Nothing more.

Copy this database and the fakenames database to your server in the same folder and you're good to go.
